# Industrial_smart_manufacturing_project
Inudstry 4.0 and smart manufacturing 
In this project we formulate industrial process in term of Malti-agent Reinforcement Learning
we train number of RL agents to optimal plan the activities of industrail process e.g machines, jobs, resources by respecting the constraints 
workstation, resource and precdence constraint
